Angular CLI Command:
--------------------
Create new application -- ng new <applicaion name>
Generate new Component -- ng g c <component name>( when you generate new component along with it html file, spec file, .ts file and css file will create defaulty)
Generate new module -- ng g m <module name>
Generate new service -- ng g s <service name>
Generate new directives -- ng g d <directive name>
Generate Gaurds -- ng g g <gaurd name>

Components in Angular:
----------------------
A component is key feature in Angular. A component is a class that contains temaplate event logic. Where we will use componets to pass the data to templates.
A componet can call other componet from template. 
The hierarchy of component at run time the root component can call first and it calls other components based on the requirement.

For every component a sub folder is created in the application

Root Componet-->Root Template --> Child component1 -->Child template1
                              -->Child componet2 -->Child template2

Component Metada:

@component({
templateUrl:"apptemplate", --> Tempalte contains html logic and bindings init.
selector:"democomponent", --> to call component from other component we will use it which it invoked
styles:["style.css", style2.css]--> To style the template we will css files
})
class AppComponent{      
properties
methods
}

The component is available in @agular/core package

Basic Routing in Angular:
-------------------------
Routing is an integral part of angular which allows us to navigate from one page to another page based on the browser location bar. 
So the user can experience the page changes.

Rote maps an URL to a component.
It availble in the angular/route package

Basically we will do routing using 
<base href="/"> Or
we will create custom routes in app.routing module
<a routerLink = "dashboard">

const routes: Routes =[
{path:"path1", component:Component1},
{path:"path2", component:Component2}
];
@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {
    useHash: true,
    // Don't perform initial navigation in iframes
    initialNavigation: !isIframe ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'
  })],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})

Routes-- Specifies the route table 
path -- identifies the actual url at the browser location bar
component-- specifies the which component should load
<route-outlet></router-outlet>

Modules in Angular:
-------------------
Module is collection of components, directives and pipes, which is used organise the components and directives, pipes.

Goals of Modules:
Consolidate components, directives and pipes unite them into one functionality.
A module can call other module so that we can some of components, pipes, directives public
provide services that the other modules can use.

Angular modules are called as ng module, it decorated with @NgModule decorator.

In javascript we a concept module but the difference is JS module is file but Angular module is class the contains components, pipes and directives.

Module Metadata:
declarations: specifies list thingsthat are part of current module
export: specifies list of things that are required to export.
import: list of other modules that are required to import.
providers: Specifies the list of services that can be used by the components, pipes and directives of current module.
