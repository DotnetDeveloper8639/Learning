Services in Angular:
--------------------
Service is a class, which is a collection properties and methods. which contains reusable logic and data source interactions.

service can be accessble form component and other services
services doesn't contain presentation logic it only contains business logic

Goals of Service:
To separate business logic and data access logic from components
Make component contains code for only supplying the data to the view and respond user actions also call necessary services.

How we can make a service as injectable?
To add @Injectable decorator
@Injectable({
providedIn: "root" -->provide the service locally or globally
})

what if we use database interaction and business logic in Component?
If we contain those logics in componet, the component it self havey and difficult to read and maintain.
