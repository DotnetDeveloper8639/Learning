AOT Compilation:
--------------------
In Angular browser directly cannot understand angular templates and type script code. For this AOT compiler compile all the 
angular code into Javascript at compile time and send it to browser. So that browser can uderstand it. 
Because of this the rendering of the page will be fast and many of the html template errors can caught before user identify it.

Before Angular8 JIT compiler was the default compiler for Angular.
After Angular 10 AOT is the default compiler in Angular.

Differences between AOT and JIT
-------------------------------
The main difference between them is 
AOT compile the things at compile time where as JIT do the process at run time.

You can configure AOT in angular.json file.
aot is true.
