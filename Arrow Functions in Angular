Arrow Functions:
----------------
Arrow functions in Angular is similar to the anonymous functions in other languages.
we can create by using fat arrow.

let sum = (x: number, y: number): number => {
    return x + y;
}

the above function can convert like this in Javascript
var sum = function (x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

Also we can create like without parameters
let sum = () => Console.log("Arrow function called");

let sum = (x: number, y: number) => x+ y;
